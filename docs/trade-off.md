# Trade-offs: Replacing a 3-Layer Architecture with a Monolithic Architecture

## Advantages of Moving to a Monolith
1. **Simplicity in Deployment**
   - Only one deployable unit, so no need for coordinating multiple services or layers.
   - Easier for small teams to manage.
   
2. **Reduced Operational Overhead**
   - No separate hosting, scaling, and monitoring for each layer.
   - Fewer network hops → lower latency in some cases.

3. **Easier to Debug**
   - Logs, stack traces, and state are all in one place.
   - No distributed tracing needed.

4. **Faster Initial Development**
   - Less boilerplate around service contracts, APIs, and inter-service communication.

## Disadvantages (What You Lose)
1. **Loss of Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - Data access, aggregation, and product-specific logic can get tightly coupled.
   - Harder to isolate domain logic from presentation concerns.

2. **Reduced Reusability**
   - Aggregation logic can’t be reused easily across multiple products without duplication.
   - Any change in one area risks breaking unrelated parts.

3. **Scaling Limitations**
   - Can’t independently scale the aggregation or product layers.
   - One bottleneck (e.g., heavy aggregation query) can slow the whole system.

4. **Harder to Evolve**
   - Over time, monoliths tend to become **“big balls of mud”** — harder to refactor.
   - Introducing new products or channels may require major rewrites.

5. **Slower Deployments at Scale**
   - Even a small change requires redeploying the entire system.
   - Testing becomes heavier because all modules are linked.

## Rule of Thumb
- **Monolith** works best for **small teams, simpler domains, and early-stage products** where speed matters more than scalability or separation.
- **Layered / Modular architecture** works better for **multi-product ecosystems, long-lived systems, and larger teams** where isolation and scalability matter.
