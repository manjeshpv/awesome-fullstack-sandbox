# Tipping Point: Moving from Monolith to Layered Architecture

## Indicators for Moving to a Layered Architecture

You might consider transitioning from a monolith to a layered/modular architecture when:

1. **Team Coordination Overhead Becomes Painful**
   - Frequent merge conflicts.
   - Developers blocked by others' work.
   - Long PR review times because changes touch unrelated areas.

2. **Change Frequency & Risk Are Too High**
   - Small changes require retesting the entire system.
   - Bugs in one part of the code break unrelated features.

3. **Scaling Needs Diverge**
   - Certain components require more resources than others.
   - Can't scale subsystems independently, leading to overprovisioning.

4. **Multiple Products/Channels Share the Same Core**
   - Web, mobile, partner APIs needing the same aggregated data differently.
   - Desire to reuse aggregation logic without pulling in product-specific logic.

5. **Onboarding New Developers Is Slow**
   - Ramp-up takes months instead of weeks.
   - System complexity is too high for one person to fully grasp.

## Developer Count vs. Architecture Suitability

| Team Size | Recommended Architecture | Rationale |
|-----------|--------------------------|-----------|
| **< 10**  | Monolith                  | Minimal coordination overhead, simpler deployments. |
| **10–40** | Monolith with Modular Boundaries | Start enforcing internal structure to reduce coupling. |
| **40–100**| Modular Monolith / Layered Architecture | Reduce coordination bottlenecks, clear domain boundaries. |
| **100+**  | Layered or Service-Oriented Architecture | Independent scaling, faster parallel development, org alignment. |

## Rule of Thumb
- **< 40 developers**: You can often stay monolithic but apply modular design patterns.
- **40–100 developers**: Strong case for layered architecture or a modular monolith.
- **100+ developers**: Layered architecture or microservices-like separation is often essential to maintain productivity.

## Why This Matters
As team size and product complexity grow, communication and integration overhead increases. Clear architectural boundaries reduce friction, improve scalability, and allow teams to work more independently.
